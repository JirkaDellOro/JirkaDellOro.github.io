# Feier für Calvin
Hier noch einige Infos zum Ablauf unserer Feier. Calvin ist nur wenig eingeweiht, freuen wir uns darauf ihn zu überraschen und diesen Tag zu einem besonderen in seinem Leben zu machen.

## Ort und Zeit
Wir speisen im [Gasthaus Heiligenbrunnen](http://www.heiligenbrunnen.de/), um 12.00 Uhr geht es los. Das Heiligenbrunnen hat nur eine recht kleine Küche und sie wünschen sich, dass wir möglichst zahlreich zu einer Zeit erscheinen. Ab 17.00 Uhr ziehen wir uns in die Apart-Bar des Parkhotel Waldeck in Titisee zurück und feiern dort in Calvins Geburtstag hinein. Dabei können wir den wunderschönen [Wellnessbereich](https://www.parkhotel-waldeck.de/wellness-im-hotel/baden-und-sauna) des Hotels nutzen! Badehose nicht vergessen...

Wenn das Wetter schön ist, empfehlen wir vom Heiligenbrunnen zu Fuß hinabzusteigen zum Titisee. In dem Fall sollte, wer mit dem Auto kommt, dieses am Parkhotel abstellen und dann mit dem [Zäpfle Bähnle](https://www.zaepfle-baehnle.de/) zum Heiligenbrunnen fahren. Die Bahn sollte etwa um 11.30 Uhr losfahren, am besten sicherheitshalber vorher anrufen.

### For Good (Wicked)
I've heard it said, that people come into our lives  
for a reason, bringing something we must learn.  
And we are led to those who help us most to grow,  
if we let them, and we help them in return.  
Well I don't know if I believe that's true,  
But I know I'm who I am today because I knew you...  

Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun,  
Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood.   
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?  
But because I knew you, I have been changed for good.  

It well may be that we will never meet again  
In this lifetime so let me say before we part:  
So much of me is made of what I learned from you.  
You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart.  
And now whatever way our stories end,  
I know you have re-written mine by being my friend...  

Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea,  
Like a seed dropped by a sky bird in a distant wood,  
Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But  
Because I knew you...  Because I knew you...  
I have been changed for good.  

And just to clear the air I ask forgiveness  
For the things I've done you blame me for.
But then, I guess we know there's blame to share
And none of it seems to matter anymore

### Father and Son  
It's not time to make a change, just relax, take it easy  
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found something going on  
But take your time, think a lot, think of everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not  

How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again  
It's always been the same, same old story  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go - away  
I know, I have to go  

It's not time to make a change, just sit down, take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
 
(Away, away, away, I know  
I have to make this decision alone - no)  

All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go - away  
I know, I have to go  
  
(Stay, stay, stay, why must you go and  
Make this decision alone? No)
