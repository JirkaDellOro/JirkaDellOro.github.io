I heat up, I cant cool down
c                  f
You got me spinnin, round and round

round and round and round it goes
c             f
Where it stops nobody knows
 
[Verse 2]
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin flame
Burnin flame full of desire

Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

Abra-abra-cadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
 
[Verse 3]
You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse 4]
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angels face
 
 [Verse 5]
I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think Im gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say
 
[Chorus]
[Repeat Verse 2] 
 
[Outro]
I heat up, I cant cool down
My situation goes round and round
