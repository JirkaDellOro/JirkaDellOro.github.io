Joni Mitchell - Both sides now


A D A D 2x

A 		 Bm 	  D 	A 		     C#m 	       D      A
Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
            D 			 Bm 		 D 					  E
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at cloud that way.
But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.
So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.

     A 		   Bm 		   D 		  A
I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
     D      A         D         A
From up and down, and still somehow
     C#m       D 		 A
It's clouds illusions I recall.
  D                 E Esus E  A 
I really don't know clouds at all.

A D A D 2x


Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.

I've looked at love from both sides now,
From win and lose, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall.
I really don't know love at all.


Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud,
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.
But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say
I've changed.
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day.

I've looked at life from both sides now,
From win and lose, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall.
I really don't know life at all.
