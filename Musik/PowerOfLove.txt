The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, mmm make a wrong right
Power of love will keep you home at night

G                     C           D
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
F                 0220
But it might just save your life

That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it might make you sad
Next time you feel it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power that makes the world go round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair, yeah, but you don't care

But you know what to do
D#           A#
When it gets hold of you
D#           0220
And with a little help from above

You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?

Don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel it until you feel
You feel the power, feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
