Somebody That I Used to Know
Gotye, 2011

[Intro] - x5 -: Am  G  Am  G

[Verse 1]
Am       G              Am      G     Am   G  Am C
Now and then I think of when we were together
Am            G                Am     G        Am  G Am C
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Am     G                  Am         C
Told myself that you were right for me
Am           G             Am      G
But felt so lonely in your company
Am            G                Am       G     Am    G  Am  G
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

Bridge - x4 -: Am  G  Am  G

[Verse 2]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

[Chorus]
Am      G              F     G
But you didn't have to cut me off
Am        G            xA#x         	G          Am
Make out like it never happened		And that we were nothing
    G             F       G
And I don't even need your love
         Am              G	          F       G
But you treat me like a stranger	And that feels so rough
Am    G              F      C
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Am         G                   xA#x		          G           Am
Have your friends collect your records		And then change your number
  G                  F          C
I guess that I don't need that though
Am               G              F      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Am               G              F      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Am               G              F      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know



[Verse 2]
Am       G             Am                  G          Am  G Am C
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Am          G                F              G      Am   G Am G
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
Am    G            F       G
And I don't wanna live that way
Am       G          F      C
Reading into every word you say
Am   G                   F     C
You said that you could let it go
Am                       G              F            G
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus]


Am G  F  C
I used to know
Am  G  F       C
That I used to know

Am G F C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
