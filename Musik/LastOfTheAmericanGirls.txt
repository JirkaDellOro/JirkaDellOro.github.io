[Bass only]
C                                                        F
She puts her makeup on Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
              C                                        D
She's got her little book of conspiracies Right in her hand
       C                                               F
She is paranoid like Endangered species headed into extinction
       C
She is one of a kind 
          D                    C
She's the last of the American girls

              00xx                                   25xx    24xx 25xx 27xx
She wears her overcoat For the coming of the nuclear winter
        00xx                                       47xx 57xx 47xx 07xx  
She is riding her bike Like a fugitive of critical mass
           00xx                                             25xx 24xx 25xx 27xx
She's on a hunger strike For the ones who won't make it for dinner
            00xx                                     47xx 57xx 47xx 07xx 
She makes enough to survive For a holiday of working class
[Full chords] C          C7                 0553    0543
She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated.
           C
She won't cooperate
                D
Well, she's the last of the American girls

She plays her vinyl records Singing songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for All the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first For the end of western civilization
She's an endless war She's a hero for a lost cause
Like a hurricane In the heart of the devastation
She's a natural disaster
She's the last of the American girls

She puts her makeup on Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies Right in her hand
She will come in first For the end of western civilization
She's a natural disaster 
She's the last of the American girls

oh yeah
all right
oh yeah
