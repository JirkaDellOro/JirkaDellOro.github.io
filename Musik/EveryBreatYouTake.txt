Every Breath You Take
The Police 1983

[Intro]
F Dm A# C F
 
[Verse]
F (0010)
Every breath you take
               Dm (0210)
Every move you make
               A# (3210)
Every bond you break
               C (0003)
Every step you take
                 Dm
I'll be watching you
 
 
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
 
[Chorus]
             A#                  F
Oh can't you see, you belong to me
                  G7 (2212)                      C
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
 
[Verse]
And every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you          
 
[Bridge]
 
Db (1114)                                   D# (3331)
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
                                      Db
I dream at night, I can only see your face
                                     D#
I look around but it's you I can't replace
                                     Db
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
                          F
I keep crying baby, baby, please
 
[Instrumental]
Dm  A#  C  Dm
 
[Chorus]
Oh can't you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
 
                 F
Every breath you take
               Dm
Every move you make
               A#
Every bond you break
               C
Every step you take
                 F
I'll be watching you
