[Verse]
A                           Em         D           A
 Living life if fun & we've just begun  to get our share 
       Em        D
of the world's delights
A                    Em    D        A            Em            D
(High) high hopes we have   for the future & our goal's in sight

(We!) No, we don't get depressed, here's what we call 
    Em         D
our golden rule
A                         Em             D            A
Have faith in you and the things you do, you won't go wrong,
            Em          D
this is our family jewel
