Material Girl
Peter Brown, Robert Rans, 1984

[Intro]
G  F  G  F (repeat several times)
 
[Verse 1]
G
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
F                e
I think they're O.K.
G
If they don't give me proper credit
a      F       G
I just walk away
G
They can beg and they can plead
F                       e
But they can't see the light, that's right
G
Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
   a      F        G
Is always Mister Right, 'cause we are
 
[Chorus]
C  D           D      e
Living in a material world
    C         D      e
And I am a material girl
G
You know that we are
C   D          D      e
living in a material world
    C         D      G
And I am a material girl
 
[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day, 'cause they are
 
[Chorus] (x2)

G              F
Living in a material world [material]
G              F
Living in a material world
G              F
Living in a material world [material]
G              F
Living in a material world
 
[Verse 3]
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me, 'cause everybody's
 
[Chorus]
 
G
A material, a material, a material, a material world
G              F
Living in a material world [material]
G              F
Living in a material world
G
A material, a material, a material, a material world
G              F
Living in a material world [material]
G              F
Living in a material world
