Budapest
George Ezra

[Verse 1]
C
My house in Budapest; My hidden treasure chest,
C
Golden grand piano; My beautiful Castillo
 
 
[Bridge]
F
For you
C
I’d leave it all
 
 
[Verse 2]
My acres of a land; I have achieved
It may be hard for you to; Stop and believe
 
 
[Bridge] (x2)
But for you
I’d Leave it all
 
 
[Chorus]
G                           F
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
C
And baby if you hold me then all of this will go away
 
 
[Verse 3]
My many artifacts, the list goes on
If you just say the words, I’ll up and run
 
 
[Bridge] (x2)
Oh, to you
I’d leave it all
 
 
[Chorus] (x2)
 
[Verse 4]
My friends and family; They, don’t understand
They fear they’d lose so much; If, you took my hand
 
[Bridge]
But, for you,
I’d lose it all.
 
 
[Chorus] (x2)
 
[Verse 1]
 
[Bridge] (x2)
