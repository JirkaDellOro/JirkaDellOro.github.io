Girls And Boys Ukulele by Blur

[Intro]
Am D G F
 
[Verse 1]
Am                         D
Streets like a jungle, so call the police
G               F
Following the herd down to Greece on holiday
Am                D
Love in the '90s is paranoid
G                             F
On sunny beaches, take your chances looking for
 
 
[Chorus]
Am
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
D
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
G                                 F
Always should be someone you really love
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am                D
Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available
G                             F
Like battery thinkers, count your thoughts on one, two, three, four, five fingers
Am                D
Nothing is wasted, only reproduced
G                             F
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr schÃ¶n, but we haven't been introduced
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
Am D G F
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
