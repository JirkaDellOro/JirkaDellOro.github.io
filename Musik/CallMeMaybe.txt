[Intro]
G
 
[Verse 1]
023x (G)
I threw a wish in the well,
043x (e)
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
000x (C)
I looked to you as it fell,
022x (D)
and now you're in my way

I trade my soul for a wish,
pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
but now you're in my way

G                                 e
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot night, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
0000 (G)				0232 0220
	Hey, I just met you,
0220 (D) 				023x 0000				
	and this is crazy,
	
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right,
at you baaaabeh,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?
 
Hey, I just met you,
and this is crazy,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?

And all the other boys,
try to chase me,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
but still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
but it's in my way

G                                 Em
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot night, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
 
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

 
It's hard to look right,
at you baaaabeh,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?
 
Hey, I just met you,
and this is crazy,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?
 
And all the other boys,
try to chaaase me,
but here's my number,
so call me, maybe?
