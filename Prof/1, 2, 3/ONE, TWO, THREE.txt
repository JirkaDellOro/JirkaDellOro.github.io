FADE IN:
THE BRANDENBURG GATE - LATE AUGUST, 1961 - DAY
CAMERA PANS DOWN from the quadriga, atop the Gate, to the
barbed wire blocking the approach nelow. The Gate is heavily
guarded by East German policemen, and there is no traffic.
MacNaMARA'’ VOICE
On Sunday, August 13th, 1961, the eyes
of America were on the nation's capital
-- where Roger Maris was hitting Home
Runs No. 44 and 45 against the Senators.
On that same day, without any warning,
the East German Communists sealed off
the border between Zast and West Berlin.
EAT. KURFUERSTENDAMM - DAY .
4 black, chauffeur-driven, Mercedes limousine, with West Berlin
license plates and a small American flag on the fender, is moving
through twaffic. In the back seatis C. R. MachAMARA.
. MacNsMARA 'S VOICE |
I only mention this to show the kind
of people we're dealing with. Real
shifty. Having been stationed in
Berlin, and having dealt with them,
I know what I'm talking about. -
—
THE BRANDENBURG GATE - EARLY JUNE, 1961 - DAY
The Gate is open, and a few West Berlin policemen are casually
waving through the cars headed for the East zone. «A sign in f.g. warns: »CHTUNG! YOU ARE NOW LEaVING WEST BERLIN. —
MacNAMARA'S VOICE
Let's go back to last June. Considering
the abnormal situation of a divided city,’
life in Berlin was more or less normal,
Traffic flowed freely through the |
Brandenburg Gate -- .
_ THE EAST SIDE OF THE BRANDENBURG GATE - DAY
Automobiles, motorcycles and pedestrians are being stopped by East German border police,. who examine identification papers, search brief cases, peer into the trunks of cars.
MacNAMARA'S VOICE -- and it wasn't really too much trouble
to pass from one side of the Iron Curtain
to the other. Some of the East German police were rude and suspicious -- others
were suspicious and rude. ‘
A RUBBLED THOROUGHFARE IN EAST BERLIN - DAY
A proletarian parade is in progress -- grim-faced marchers
carrying inflammatory banners, placards, and blown-up photographs of Communist big-shots -- while singing the Internationale at the top of their lungs.
MacNAMARA'S VOICE
The Eastern sector, under Communist
domination, was still in rubble -- . but the people went about their daily a
business -- parading. .
Those inflammatory banners are now passing the camera. Among
the sentiments expressed are:
NIKITA UBER ALLES! NIE WIEDER U-2! .. KENNEDY, NEIN! ‘CASTRO, JA! HEIL MAO TSE-TUNG!. | AUF-IN DEN COSMOS MIT YURI GAGARIN! WAS IST LOS IN LITTLE ROCK? |
Bringing up the rear area group of schoolgirls, holding big clusters. of balloons over their heads. Stamped on each of them isa friendly. little hint!) YANKEE GO HOME! The girls release the balloons. They float upward, and followed by the CAMERA, drift slowly toward
West Berlin.
SKYLINE OF WEST BERLIN - DAY
It's an n entirely different world. The CAMERA, _ continuing its move, PANS DOWN the Gedaechtniskirche, and pasta series of ultra- modern office buildings, some just completed, others still under |
construction.
(CONTINUED)
like it a bit.
CONTINUED:
MacNAMARA'S VOICE
These constant provocations failed to
provoke the West Berliners. They
were too busy rebuilding. The Western
sector, under Allied protection, was
peaceful, prosperous, and enjoyed all
the blessings of democracy.
The CAMERA HAS STCGPPED on an enormous billboard, featuring an attractive Nordic blonde sipping from a familiar botile. The catchline reads:

EXT. COCA-COLA BUILDING - DAY
A’ modern three- -story structure, with a bottling plant on the ground floor and offices above. Coca-Cola delivery trucks are rumbling down the driveway as the Mercedes limousine pulls up in front of the entrance. The chauffeur, in livery, and black boots, jumps. out, flings the rear door open, then comes to attention, cap-in-hand. His name is FRITZ -- what else? Out of the car steps MacNamara, a brisk, incisive, high-octane type of American businessman abroad. He wears a Brooks Brothers suit and a Panama hat, carries a brief case and an umbrella. He was fifty last February, and he doesn't

MacNAMARA :

He starts across the sidewalk toward the entrance of the building. Fritz slams the car door shut, puts his cap on, rushes after MacNamara, just beats him to the big glass front doors. Stencilled on the glass is:

INT, LOBBY - COCA-COLA BUILDING - DAY
48 MacNamara crosses the lobby, Fritz again overtakes him, ' proceeds out of scene. MacNamara stops before a large glass window giving on the vottling plant. Seated on high stools along the
assembly line are two dozen white-smocked employees, supervising the operation -- bottles being washed, inspected, filled with syrup,
filled with water, capped, shaken, crated. MacNamara surveys the
scene with satisfaction, then heads for the elevator.
Waiting at the elevator is Fritz, cap-in-hand, holding the door
open for MacNamara.—

Fritz.closes the elevator door, jams on his cap, scoots up the
stairs like a scalded jackass.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - DAY
The elevator is coming up to the third floor (light effect). From the stairwell, we hear the sound of pounding boots. «As. the elevator stops, a panting Fritz reaches the landing, skids toward the elevator door, yanks it open, then snaps to attention, cap-in-hand. MacNamara steps out, throws Fritz a look. .
MacNaMARA
Danke schon, already.
He moves past Fritz through the open doors of the outer office.
INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY
About twenty German employees, male and female, are working at their desks, busy with typewriters, adding machines and ledgers.
As MacNamara crosses toward his private office, the employees
jump to their feet in unison, stand at rigid attention.

three burly, uniformed interrogators. A female stenographer, also in uniform, sits at a desk, fingers poised over a typewriter key- board. Lying on a table in front of Otto is the incriminating
cuckoo clock. And blasting from a phonograph, at ear-splitting _ volume, is a nasal voice singing Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.
OTTO
(pressing hands to ears)
Nein! Nein! Genug! Aufhoéren!
Schluss! Ich will schlafen!
The head interrogator turns the phonograph off.
INTERROGATOR
(shouting at Otto)
Sind Sie ein ) amerikanischer Spion?
OTTO
Nein!
INTERROGATOR - Fur wen arbeiten Sie -- C.I.A.?
OTTO
Nein! Ich will schlafen!
His head falls forward on the table -- he is asleep. The interro- gator shoves the table away -- and Otto has to catch himself to keep from falling. The female stenographer watches impassively.
The second interrogator now grabs Otto's hair, jerks his head up so that the light is in his eyes.
SECOND INTERROGATOR
Sind Sie ein amerikanischer Spion?
OTTO
Nein!
SECOND INTERROGATOR
Sind Sie ein Geheimagent von Allen Dulles?
OTTO
Nein, nein, nein, nein ~-

He raises his arm to shield his eyes from the light. The head
interrogator removes the phonograph record from the turntable.
Drilled about an inch from the center hole of the record is another
hole. He slips the spindle through the off-center hole, starts the phonograph again. It's still Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini -- but played on the bias, it comes. out as the most
nerve-wracking, marrow-chilling cacophony. Otto grabs his ears, screaming. |

The interrogator rips the now typewritten confession out of the
machine, shoves it in front’ of Otto, hands him a pen.
INTERROGATOR

Holding the pen limply, Otto barely manages to sign his name
before he falis asleep again. As the interrogator picks up the signed confession, the door opens and the three Russian commissars
enter. Borodenko approaches the interrogator, flashes his identification tag.

In the Mercedes, Ingeborg, back to camera, is looking out the

Otto across the street. She opens the car door, steps out as the
three of them come up. MacNamara and Fritz deposit Otto in the
back of the car. MacNamara gets in beside him, Fritz slips into
the front.seat with the cuckoo clock. The Mercedes shoots off,
leaving Ingeborg behind. She starts slowly across the “street

The three Siberian wolves are standing beside their car, drooling
expectantly, as Ingeborg approaches.
Maybe it's the trolley car tracks, maybe it'a the high heels, but

glances out the rear window.
It is not shots, but the backfiring of a car which is rapidly catching

STREETS OF EAST BERLIN - DAWN
The Mercedes picks up speed. The Russian car, backfiring
periodically, tries to keep up. The chase continues around corners
and traffic islands, winds up in a dead end street. The Mercedes
cuts across an empty lot. The Moskvich follows, and as it bounces
over the curb, one of the fenders falls off. The Mercedes skirts a
ruined building, but the Moskvich heads right for it, taking a short
cut through the ruins. By the time it emerges, steam is gushing
from the radiator, and one of the tires has come off. <As the —
Russian car limps along on the tireless rim, the Mercedes out~
distances it.

He starts toward the guardhouse, while the other policemen block the path of the Mercedes. As MacNamara looks back through the
rear window worriedly, Otto suddenly stirs in his sleep.
OTTO
Ich bin ein amerikanischer Spion!
MacNamara claps his hand over Otto's mouth, glances toward the policemen, to make sure they haven't overheard. At the same time, the cuckoo clock on the front seat comes to life. It is six o'clock, and Uncle Sam pops out again, to the tune of Yankee

The corporal and the other border policemen are suddenly alert. MacNamara, Ingeborg and Fritz sit there apprehensively.
As the Russian car approaches the halted Mercedes, Periretchikoff steps on the brakes. There is a squealing sound, but. nothing happens. fPeripetchikoff now yanks the hand-brake -- and it comes off in his hand. He starts steering desperately -- and the steering
wheel breaks in half. The three Russians duck as the car continues
out of control. -
The boarder policemen scatter like nine-pins as. the runaway car bears down on them. .
In the Mercedes, MacNamara, Ingeborg and Fritz follow the off- scene progress of the Russian car. There is the sound of a - tremendous crash. The corporal and the other policemen rush toward the ecene of the accident.

As for the Moskvich, it has tried to climb one of the pillars of the Brandenburg Gate, and failed.

the elevator descends, Schlemmer scurries down the stairs.

The elevator has reached the ground floor. As the passengers spill
out, Schlemmer comes pounding down the stairs, holds the front

down the front steps, a man carrying a stack of hat-boxes comes

MacNamara grabs the hat-boxes, passes thern on to Schlemmer,
They make for the parked Mercedes limousine. The painter,
kneeling beside the front door, is half-finished with the crest while
Fritz stands by watching. As the others come dashing up, Fritz
scoots around to the driver's. seat. Scarlett drags Otto into the back
of the car.

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
Speeding through traffic toward Tempelhof airport. Thereis a scramble
of activity in the car -- it looks like the inside of a Waring mixer.
Fritz is hunched over the steering wheel like Stirling Moss, the
tailor is sewing away at the striped pants, and the painteris leaning
half-way out the window working on the crest. In the back seat, Ottois
clutching the flowers, Scarlett and Schlemmer are opening hat-boxes,
and MacNamara is trying to extricate his umbrella from the melee.
OTTO

were meant to wear a hat.
OTTO
I wasn't meant to be a count, either. It's
ridiculous -- who's going to believe it?
MacNAMARA
Calm down. The only royalty we know in
America is Nat King Cole, Duke Snider and

As Scarlett tries a third hat on Otto, Schlemmer starts to toss the
